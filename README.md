# BrohVario

**Arduino paragliding tool**

## Author notes

This project is forked from [IvkoPivko](https://github.com/IvkoPivko) [MiniVario-Arduino](https://github.com/IvkoPivko/MiniVario-Arduino) (Awesome code!) and was developed using the [jarzebski](https://github.com/jarzebski) [Arduino-MS5611](https://github.com/jarzebski/Arduino-MS5611) library (I attached a .zip version).

I forked it to adapt to my hardware, I want to recycle an arduino nano board I owned, but I also want to understand the code... so I translated all the comments and variables names to English.

## Release notes

### Version 20

- Completely translated to English
- Updated to work with 2S lipo battery (and sending voltage via BT)
- TODO: working on low voltage audible warning

## Wiring

Currently IvkoPivko wiring are attached, I will replace these with my 2S version asap.
